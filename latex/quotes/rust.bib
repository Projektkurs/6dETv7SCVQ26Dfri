abstract = {“Green electronics” is an emerging field of research, which focuses on sustainable and biocompatible devices. This chapter provides an overview of the sustainable approaches in the design of dielectric materials and their application in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Basic concepts and material design challenges will be discussed with recent case studies in this field, which will cover four categories of organic dielectric materials: (1) saccharide-based materials, (2) protein-based materials, (3) other water-soluble polymers, and (4) other water-insoluble polymers. This chapter puts a perspective on the potential of sustainable dielectric materials to further expand the use for OTFT application and inspire new research for developing sustainable, high-performance state-of-the-art organic electronics.}

abstract = {Electrophoretic displays (EPDs) have gained great attention recently due to its low cost, low weight, low power consumption and reliability, and they are on their way to replace conventional paper. EPDs, known as non-emitting displays based on light particle suspensions, are based on the movements of charged particles in a dielectric fluid via electrode with the opposite charge. Electrical and optical properties of EPDs suspension composition depend on the electronic ink, also called as E Ink. Therefore, major factors in electrophoretic particle properties like very small particle size, narrow size distribution and high surface charge of particles, enhance the image quality for accurate image control and faster response to the applied voltage. Thus, there are numerous researches on the modification of particles, surface morphology, surface charge and their stability in media. This review summarizes the best techniques and production methods to fabricate E Ink microcapsules for EPD applications in recent years.}
